# Minecraft Paper 1.20.2 Plugin that allows you to smelt Glowstone Dust into Glow Ink Sac

HEWWO ALL,

spent like 5 hours caving and found a single glow squid so i gave up on trying to find more they are dumb anyway since rigged mob vote

anyway this plugin lets you smelt 1 glowstone dust into 1 glow ink sac and gives you a normal amount of xp i guess idk im not minecraft expert

this is tested and working 1.20.2 paper idk if it will work in other versions but probably as long as its 1.20.X 

you need gradle to build this dont ask me for help because i myself have no idea how any of this works 

GDtoGI = GlowstoneDust to Glow Ink
